# creativecoding-grid
This code creates a moving grid using Shaders.

I learned about Shaders in a beautiful creative coding workshop by [Ilithya](https://www.ilithya.rocks/).
Using [this beautiful playground](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/) called The Force provided by Shawn Lawson.

The code uploaded here creates two grids on top of each other while moving across the x and y axis.
Feel free to copy and play around! :)

To use the code, click on [The Force](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/) and upload one of the files
to the website by clicking the little 'open file' button on the bottom of the page. 
You may also copy paste the code into the The Force website.
