# creativecoding-grid
This code creates a moving grid using Shaders.

I learned about Shaders in a beautiful creative coding workshop by [Ilithya](https://www.ilithya.rocks/).
Using [this beautiful playground](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/)  provided by Shawn Lawson.

The code uploaded here creates two grids on top of each other while moving across the x and y axis.
Feel free to copy and play around! :)
